I am a father, a software engineer, a pianist, a dancer, and an over-thinker.

###Stuff I like and would recommend

I keep intending to write a blog some day, but for now I'll just recommend someone else's blog that I enjoy: [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/).

My favorite Romantic poem is *Ulysses* by Alfred Lord Tennyson, my favorite cello concerto is the Elgar, and my favorite rock album is Pink Floyd's *Wish You Were Here*. I would recommend [*Galina: A Russian Story*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630723.Galina) to literally anyone. Seriously, go read it.

If you don't mind subtitles, or if you speak German, go watch [*Das Leben Der Anderen*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/).

###But this is primarily a software website! Talk about that!

I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it, and I care a lot (perhaps too much) about language-design, but I don't particularly like any of the languages I've used extensively.

In theory, I'm pretty sure I'd like Rust, Julia, and maybe Kotlin, but I haven't done much coding with them yet. Some day maybe I'll write my own language.

I like the fact that C++ exists, but actually needing to use it makes me sad. I feel similarly about Perl, but fortunately my day job doesn't require Perl.

Ruby is pretty good.
